# Map-API-Project

 This is a project to compare various map APIs, using a very basic html/js/css framework with callouts to the APIs.
 All map APIs will have the same basic framework - to make the comparisons as fair as possible.
 The maps will be centred on Paisley, Scotland, at zoom level 15, have three points of interest pinned to the map, and have the user location pinned (if known).
